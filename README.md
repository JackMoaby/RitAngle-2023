### Clues
<pre>
You will be creating a rectangular crossnumber grid
All cells in the grid are used, being occupied by a single digit
Entries are separated by a bold grid line
Bold grid lines are shown in any tetromino that includes a cell either side of that line
The outside grid boundary has no bold grid lines
Tetrominoes can only be rotated, not flipped
The six tetrominoes have to be assembled and numbered in normal crossnumber fashion
No crossnumber entry starts with 0
All crossnumber entries are unique
1 down is a multiple of 9 across
14 across is triangular
9 across is a multiple of 10 down
Both 2 across and 2 down are triangular
Both 5 across and 5 down are triangular
4 down is triangular
6 down is triangular
7 down is prime
8 across is prime
8 across is a factor of 12 across
11 across is greater than 12 across
3 down is triangular
10 down is triangular
12 across is triangular
13 across is triangular
Only 3 grid squares are not covered by triangular numbers
Your codeword is revealed by using the 8 digits from the middle row of the crossnumber and converting each in turn to one of the three possibilities offered by the conversion: 1=A,J,S; 2=B,K,T; 3=C,L,U; 4=D,M,V; 5=E,N,W; 6=F,O,X; 7=G,P,Y; 8=H,Q,Z; 9=I,R; 
Only 2 primes appear as answers
The sum of the entered digits equals 9 across plus 11 across
